This project was put together in conjunction with a CircleCi.com pipeline and an AWS account to experiment with continuous deployment and creating/updating an AWS lambda from the CircleCi config. 

This site is currently (20230223) deployed at: http://circleciangularbucket.s3-website-us-west-2.amazonaws.com

You can tell that isn't just a default Angular boiler plate because "Welcome" in the top left is actually "Welcomee". Besides that the site being hosted on the AWS bucket endpoint had basically nothing to do with the experiment.
